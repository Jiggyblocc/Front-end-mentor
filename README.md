What I learned
In the process of completing this project I understood better the concepts of layouts and even though I'm not yet perfect on it I'll be sure to work more towards perfecting it. I also learnt how to style a container div in this project and i can proudly say i have learnt something.

Continued development
Going forward I'll love to go back and perfect myself on CSS layouts and animations. I'll also be spending more time n media queries to help me understand responsiveness better.

Useful resources
